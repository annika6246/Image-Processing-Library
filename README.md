# Image-Processing-Library

### The program takes two command line arguments, the first being the input path of the image file, the second being the output path of the output file. Both of these arguments should include the ending for example ".jpg" as part of the path. The example command line arguments included are sampleImages/iceland.JPG and sampleImages/out.jpg.
